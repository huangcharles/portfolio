        This web page was created as a digital portfolio for Charlie Huang's work in Advanced Computer Science, completed concurrently at Rosemount High School and Inver Hills Community College in the 2019-20 AY, taught by Professor Dr. Thomas Reinartz, Ph.D. The site's Khemistry Fun! tab features photos, memes, and haikus relating to AP Khemistry, a term of endearment given by the students of Ms. Kendra Olsen's 2017-18 AP Chemistry class at Rosemount High School.

<b><h2>Progress via Popcorn</h2></b>
<em>“Popcorn, one dollar,” I meekly declare from the corner of the school courtyard, carrying a hefty
cardboard box heaping with bags of buttery popcorn.
 <br><br>
    Though it’s a brisk evening in September of my sophomore year, I’m sweating as I struggle to sell popcorn to a crowd watching</em> Moana <em>at my school’s Student Council-run movie night. From the back, my mellow calls fade away with the gentle gusts of wind. This isn’t what I imagined when I signed up to sell concessions as a Student Council member, and it’s somewhat scary for a timid, slightly nerdy teenager like me.</em>
 <br><br>
For most students, lunch is the best part of the school day; for me, it used to be the worst. I’d sit alone
at the corner of a table—coincidentally beside some “cool” kids—eat quickly, then try to finish some
homework. Trying to find my place, I joined several clubs, including applying for the Student Council. I
didn’t think I’d prevail against more popular peers; thankfully, I was wrong.
    <br><br>
<em>Trying to destress, I look toward the movie projected onto the courtyard wall. The song “How Far I’ll Go” rings in my ears: 
 <br><br>
“I know everybody on this island has a role on this island, so maybe I can roll with mine.”
 <br><br>
Hearing that lyric, I ponder what my role is.</em>
 <br><br>
Student Council helped me find my role. Being accepted onto the Council meant that I was appointed to
represent hundreds of students I barely recognized. I used to think that relationships wouldn’t matter if I
excelled academically, but my new role inspired me to get to know my peers—not as the background in
the hallway—but as unique people with unique stories.
    <br><br>
<em>Nobody can hear me over the blaring movie. I’m not selling any popcorn. I suppose I’ll have to be louder. 
 <br><br>
“POPCORN, ONE DOLLAR! ONE DOLLA’ POPCORN!” With every announcement, my confidence soars. Within minutes, I’m traversing amongst the audience like a concessions vendor at a Minnesota Twins baseball game, and a line starts to form. Eventually, my once heaping box is empty, and I need to stock up with more.</em>
 <br><br>
My greatest accomplishments are not sufficiently reflected by a title or a line on a resume. What rose as a desire to represent my peers resulted in an unimaginable personal enrichment in which I discovered the profoundness of relationships. 
 <br><br>
Early sophomore year, I started to foster meaningful relationships. I remember one of the first times: I
hesitantly asked about a classmate’s lacrosse game. Soon, I became engrossed in the compelling story of
a hard-fought battle against a rival and the victory-ensuring shot in the final seconds. Now, I’m often
catching up with my peers: a titration lab in chem, a grueling marching band competition, a hot-button
political issue, or something as mundane as oversleeping and missing the school bus.
    <br><br>
Motivated by the stories of the people I met, I organized a town hall to hear student voices and concerns. Blossoming relationships sparked candid discussion with peers over issues like ballooning class sizes or mental health resources; when lobbying for increased public education funding by the state, I was able to convey their stories.
 <br><br>
I am sure that these genuine conversations and interactions propelled me from sitting alone at lunch as
a freshman to being voted Student Body President as a junior and Homecoming King as a senior.

Nonetheless, my greatest accomplishments are not sufficiently reflected by a title or a line on a resume.
What rose as a desire to represent my peers resulted in an unimaginable personal enrichment in which I
discovered the profoundness of relationships. Through getting to know my fellow peers, I rediscovered
not just what I could be, but what I should be: coupling social engagement and academic passion to
inform advocacy and policy.
    <br><br>
This past June, in the warm radiance of the Minnesota summer, I enjoyed some grad party-hopping. Relaxing between rounds of ladder golf, I sat down with friends to delve into some (free!) popcorn. The familiar aroma and the vibrant social atmosphere reminded me of selling popcorn at movie night. The song “We Know The Way” from <em>Moana</em> resonated within me:
<br><br>
<em>“We know where we are; we know who we are.”</em>

<b><h2>Is late night comedy a news source?</h2></b>
When studying for AP US Government and Politics, I read about a study that indicated viewers of late
night comedy were not only more informed about the news than people who watched no news, but Jon
Stewart or Stephen Colbert fans were more informed than viewers of cable news. Though cable news
networks often work hard to generate high-quality journalism, the partisan tilt that permeates cable
news today often results in a rigid delineation of its audience, one that’s ravaged by confirmation bias
and watches a specific news network not to be informed but to feel informed. Today, I think people
watch the news to feel smart because they know that a commentator will inevitably say something that
agrees with them. Today, I think people watch the news to fortify an arsenal of talking points to deploy
when arguing about politics.
    <br><br>

With that being said, perhaps cable news is not truly news anymore because it fails to satisfy the
purpose of news: to not merely inform, but to promote deeper thinking, analysis, questioning, and self-
reflection.
    <br><br>

When I’m at my lunch table debating religious freedom or gun control with my friends, I know that
there’s a serious lack of critical thinking going on when I hear, verbatim, the same points articulated by a
cable news pundit I saw the night before. Argument regurgitation is easy—questioning qualified sources
is hard.
    <br><br>

Despite late night comedy shows being broadcast at 10:30 or 11:30 at night, they still attract millions of
viewers daily. My two favorite late night shows, Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert, often focus their comedy on the latest political news. Right before I opened a doc to
write this essay, I was watching a clip of Meyers ridiculing Trump for modifying a forecast map of
Hurricane Dorian with a Sharpie marker, entertaining the idea of the President being impeached not for
obstruction of justice or for violating the Emoluments Clause, but rather for modifying a National
Weather Service forecast.
    <br><br>

When I’m sitting on my bed on Saturday morning, watching YouTube clips of Meyers and Colbert from
the previous week, I learn about what’s going on in the world through the lens of skeptics searching for
absurdity. The issues of the time are serious, but late night hosts have found success in explaining
complexity with comedy because finding the absurdity in the world forces viewers to carefully
contemplate arguments that seem rhetorically strong but are argumentatively incoherent. Indeed, late night shows are just as partisan as, if not more partisan than, cable news sources, but late night hosts
promote deeper thinking, analysis, questioning, and self-reflection—just like a news source should.
    <br><br>

I like to ask questions. My friends say that I ask too many questions, but I think that makes me—like
Meyers or Colbert—a habitual skeptic. In policy debate, an activity I’ve been engrossed in for the past
four years, I’ve been conditioned to be a skeptic because that mindset helps win debates. In a debate
round, I’m constantly asking questions like, “how do you know that,” “why should we believe that
source,” “is there a contradiction here,” or most commonly, “why might this argument be wrong?” In
debate, I ask tough questions in order to win a round. In school, I ask tough questions to better explore
the content. In everyday life, I ask tough questions because I think it helps my knowledge grow from
more to more and so be my life enriched.
    <br><br>

Late night comedy, likewise, helps knowledge grow from more to more, and that should be enough to
qualify it as a news source.

    Lightning!
    Press anywhere on the screen to simulate a Faraday Cage! <br>
    This simulates an electric current generated by a Van de Graaff generator that travels through a Faraday Cage. When the current strikes the surface of the Faraday Cage--made with a conducting material--the current travels along the surface and exits from another point on the surface. Since the interior of the cage is (relatively) insulating, the current does not enter the cage. An example of a Faraday Cage is a modern airplane; when lightning strikes the plane in mid-air, all passengers are safe because the current travels through the surface of the fuselage and does not enter the insulating cabin.

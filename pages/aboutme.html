<em><h2>Popcorn</h2></em>
<em>“Popcorn, one dollar,” I meekly declare from the corner of the school courtyard, carrying a hefty cardboard box heaping with bags of buttery popcorn.
 <br><br>
    Though it’s a brisk evening in September of my sophomore year, I’m sweating as I struggle to sell popcorn to a crowd watching</em> Moana <em>at my school’s Student Council-run movie night. From the back, my mellow calls fade away with the gentle gusts of wind. This isn’t what I imagined when I signed up to sell concessions as a Student Council member, and it’s somewhat scary for a timid, slightly nerdy teen like me.</em>
 <br><br>
For most students, lunch is the best part of the school day; for me, it used to be the worst. I’d sit alone at the corner of a table—coincidentally beside some “cool” kids—eat quickly, then try to finish some homework. Trying to find my place, I joined several clubs, including applying for Student Council. I didn’t think I’d prevail against more popular peers; gratefully, I was wrong.
 <br><br>
<em>Trying to destress, I look toward the movie projected onto the courtyard wall. The song “How Far I’ll Go” rings in my ears: 
 <br><br>
“I know everybody on this island has a role on this island, so maybe I can roll with mine.”
 <br><br>
Hearing that lyric, I ponder what my role is.</em>
 <br><br>
Student Council helped me find my role. Being accepted onto the Council meant that I was appointed to represent hundreds of students I barely recognized in the halls. I used to think that relationships wouldn’t matter if I excelled academically, but my new role inspired me to get to know my peers—not as a background to my high school experience—but as unique elements of it.
 <br><br>
<em>Nobody can hear me over the blaring movie. I’m not selling any popcorn. I suppose I’ll have to be louder. 
 <br><br>
“POPCORN, ONE DOLLAR! ONE DOLLA’ POPCORN!” With every announcement, my confidence soars. Within minutes, I’m traversing amongst the audience like a concessions vendor at a Minnesota Twins baseball game, and a line starts to form. Eventually, my once heaping box is empty, and I need to stock up with more.</em>
 <br><br>
My greatest accomplishments are not sufficiently reflected by a title or a line on a resume. What rose as a desire to represent my peers resulted in an unimaginable personal enrichment in which I discovered the profoundness of relationships. 
 <br><br>
Early sophomore year, I started to foster meaningful relationships. I remember one of the first times: I hesitantly asked about a classmate’s lacrosse game. Soon, I became engrossed in the compelling story of a hard-fought battle against a rival and the victory-ensuring shot in the final seconds. Now, I’m often catching up with what’s new in life: a titration lab in chem, a grueling marching band competition, the hot-button political issue of the day, or something as mundane as oversleeping and missing the school bus. 
 <br><br>
Motivated by the stories of the people I met, I organized a town hall to hear student voices and concerns. Blossoming relationships sparked candid discussion with peers over issues like ballooning class sizes or mental health resources; when lobbying for increased public education funding by the state, I was able to convey their stories.
 <br><br>
Through getting to know my fellow peers, I rediscovered not just what I could be, but what I should be: coupling social engagement and academic passion to not only inform advocacy and policy, but also to satisfy intrinsic cravings for both academic endeavors and social interactions.
 <br><br>
This past June, in the warm radiance of the Minnesota summer, I enjoyed some grad party-hopping. Relaxing between rounds of ladder golf, I sat down with friends to delve into some (free!) popcorn. The familiar aroma and the vibrant social atmosphere reminded me of selling popcorn at movie night. The song “We Know The Way” from <em>Moana</em> resonated within me:
<br><br>
<em>“We know where we are; we know who we are.”</em>

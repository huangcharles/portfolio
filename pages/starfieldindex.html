            Problem 1: General Gist

        </h3>
        <br>
        <h4>
This lab is, perhaps, the lab which I have incorporated the least number of creative elements. However, this does not mean problems were not encountered. One of the core challenges faced here involved merely understanding what was going on and getting something to work. The solution required creative, unbounded, and sometimes unreasoned changes to the code to “see what [the change] does.” With enough iterations, the result of the appearance of pulsating spirals was formed.

            Problem 2: Speed of pulsation

        </h3>
        <br>
        <h4>
The “speed” of the pulsation can be loosely defined as the rate at which the dots circle back in and collapse to the center. Moderating this speed was resolved by increasing/decreasing the frame rate to create the desired effect.

                    Problem 3: Clock

        </h3>
        <br>
        <h4>
The clock, with just timeInt, rapidly increases. However, suppose the goal was to increment whenever the three oddballs collapse into the center. To determine the proper factor of division for timeInt, multiple numbers were tested. Ultimately, through a process of essentially trial-and-error, 63 was determined to be the optimal division factor for at least a short period. The dots seem to slow down as time progresses, so a lurking problem remains to be solved.
